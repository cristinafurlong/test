PITCH

Welcome to Martin Luther King Jr. High School.  A Public School on the Upper West Side near Lincoln Center.  Despite it's exotic location, MLK Jr. has had a turbulent past and in 2002, it was divided into small schools in an attempt to improve safety and academic performances.  The effort was short lived and in 2005, the school was phased out by the DOE (Department of Education) and what remained was a complex of these mini-schools, which now make up the entire building.

Now head east, crossing central park, and just over 2 miles from MLK Jr. is the prestigious Dalton School.  A private educational facility where tuition is just over $41,000. Famous alumni include Claire Danes, Anderson Cooper and Sean Lennon.

At first glance these two schools might not have much in common, as they seem worlds apart - socially and economically speaking. However, despite their differences, it is thanks to their love of soccer that we can better understand the teams from both an educational and athletic perspective. By taking a deeper look at the boys varsity soccer programs we can uncover information that will help us determine what encourages success rates for high school athletes (in this case soccer players) in both the public and private high school sectors. 

This project will aim to investigate, but not limited to the following issues:

What are the foundations of a successful school team program?
What are the main team challenges between the private and public school sector and how do they differ? (more money vs more time and effort? facilities? injuries?)
Where do these kids come from?  Financially? Socially? Geographically? Ethnically?
What makes a successful team/community?


WHY DO WE CARE NOW?

The social gap in this country is bigger than ever.  According to an article by the Pew Research Center last December, the gap between America’s upper-income and middle-income families has reached its highest level on record.  Instead of simply tackling this issue at a large scale, we can use these two teams as a microcosmic example of social and economical differences in order to help us better understand their role in society and within their communities.

If we can better understand the similarities and differences between these programs, we can help their communities understand the obstacles they face and how we can build more bridges in order to close the gap of inequality, especially in sports.

This is also a wider view of high school sports and how they work in both the private and public sector.  Do they help the student achieve their goals after school? How many of these kids graduate and as a result of their scholastic background in athletics, how many go to college because of it?  What are the major implications/advantages of team sports in schools and how do they help the student and their families?

WHO CARES?         

This issue is not just about the players or the coaches, it is also about their school communities, parents and even their neighborhoods. It will also be an opportunity for the teams to learn from one another.  The fact that we are dealing with schools from both the private and public sector, the data and community based investigation will create better knowledge and detailed comparisons as well as differences between the private schools and DOE.

PRE-REPORTING

We will use resources that are at our disposal, including Luis Miguel, who is the Head Coach of Dalton’s soccer team, and has direct access to the athletic department at Dalton as well as a working/personal relationship with the coaching staff at MLK Jr.
While there is data readily available on the two teams, and youth soccer as a whole, we will also incorporate proprietary intelligence that is especially important in determining each team’s championship potential as well as higher education success rates (who attends college? who receives scholarships? who plays collegiate soccer?)
We also hope to draw a dynamic and diverse set of data that will help tell a “story” for each team this season while revealing what factors influence better athleticism and academics.
We will take a look at the following data points (but not limited to):
1.) Probability of competing beyond high school - 
*Becoming a pro player in any sport is difficult, but the opportunity to play at the collegiate level still opens doors for young athletes both in and outside of the sport itself. It’s important to look at this data as we track the success rates of students to determine what percent of high school athletes are likely play on teams ranging from junior colleges to the NCAA.
2.) Dalton High School Stats - 
*Dalton High School is one of the most prestigious prep schools in the U.S. We’ll take a look at their graduation rates as well as their ethnic backdrop to see how they compare to public high schools in NYC. We’ll determine if diversity plays a role in how they fair in sports like soccer.
3.) Public high school graduation rates in NYC – 
*At a private school like Dalton in New York City there is a 100% graduation rate, but it is not the same for MLK Jr. What is interesting here is that we can compare student athletes in academics. Even if the public high schools have a higher dropout rate what does that mean for student athletes? We’ll look into academics to find out if student athletes are raising the bar and have a better chance at graduating.
4.) Competitive Youth Sport Participation - 
*We’ll examine just how many youth are participating in sports in the U.S. today while looking into several factors that contribute to their participation. This is relevant to our community because many drop out of the sport their freshman year. We’ll look at how household income, neighborhood and coaching can affect their success rates.
5.) High School Soccer Participation - 
*This is an insightful look at all high school sports participation. It is relevant to our research because it dives into just how popular the sport is as well as how competitive the sport is at the high school level.   
6.) Championships/Games won – MLK & Dalton 
*In order to evaluate the two teams we are looking at we need to go back to their win/loss records, see statistics on players as well as what championships they’ve achieved. This will determine who is the better team on paper and we’ll watch to see if that translates to the playing field.
7.) Student Eligibility for College Sports – 
*As we take a look at what it takes to win games in high school, we’ll also take a look at where students need to be when it comes to academics in order to enter college. We’ll compare and contrast what each team looks like academically speaking, and see what players are eligible to play in the NCAA if given the opportunity (based on merit).
8.) Youth soccer stats - 
*We noted that youth the dropout rate for sports increases as they get older, freshman year being particularly fragile. In this data we single out the game of soccer by age, region and gender. This will help us discover how players in New York stack against the rest of the U.S., and what makes our two schools unique compared to other areas.
9.) Injuries - 
*There are inevitable injuries in any sport. There may be players who are sidelined because of injury this year for our two teams. This is why we’ll take a look at what injuries are common, what the percentage of injuries occur in soccer and find out how this odds can affect our two teams.
10.) Below is a list of questions we are including, but are not limited to, when collecting data in our community. Answers to these questions are important in our overall portfolio because they will help determine contributing factors for each school (and for each student) when it comes to succeeding in high school level soccer.   
- Amount of hours practiced per week
- Amount of students who receive private training
- Have parents or relatives played soccer?
- Age
- H.S. year
- Race
- Residence
- Family income
- GPA
- Players planning to go to college
- Players who have been offered athletic scholarships
