<p>When it comes to finding success at the High School level in New York City there are many factors to consider: private training, natural talent, drive, economic background, team diversity and coaching to name a few. MLK Jr. High School is the most successful public school soccer team operating with minimal resources. Dalton High School, a private school, has several resources at their disposal, but to date has only produced one winning season. According to Robert Wood Johnson Foundation only a quarter of High Schoolers enrolled in poorer schools play school sports at all, but despite their lack of resources MLK Jr. is beating the odds to produce a successful team and future professional athletes.</p>

                <h4>Martin Luther King Jr. High School (Public)</h4>

        <p>Martin Luther King Jr. High School is a public school on the upper west side neighborhood of Manhattan, New York City, near Lincoln Center. Six small schools share the campus but they play together on a single soccer team.</p>

        <p>MLK Jr. High School does not currently have a practice field and must rotate locations.  The school has an indoor gym which has limited availability due to the high demand by other teams.  Practice is usually located in Riverside Park but this all depends on how early the team can get there as there always competition from other schools or organizations that also need the space.  Randall's Island is just not a possibility as the school doesn't have a bus service for after school activity and the trip to the island can take as long as an hour from the school's location.  The team needs to walk or take the subway whenever they have practice.  On game days, which are usually during the weekends, Randall's Island is available.  These fields are usually coordinated by both schools who are playing with the help of the Public School Athletic League (PSAL), the organization who runs the public school athletic teams around the city.</p>

        <p>The Dalton School is a member of the Ivy Preparatory School League in athletics. The Athletic department is located in their state of the art athletic complex, considered as one of the best in Manhattan. The Physical Education center is a 32,000 square-foot facility which houses two gymnasiums, a wrestling and aerobics room; a weight and fitness center; coaches office; a sports medicine office; locker facilities and classrooms. The outdoor sports teams utilize the soccer and baseball fields, track, and tennis courts at Randall's Island. Aside from the Physical Education complex, the team practices at Randall's Island Park by the East River in Manhattan. The outdoor space is a gigantic facility that offers soccer fields (grass and turf) to schools and organizations around the city. The team travels by bus transportation from the athletic department to the fields. It is a 25-minute commute without traffic. The athletic Department is responsible for field permits and transportation. Despite the fact that Dalton doesnâ€™t have a soccer field of it's own, they call Randall's Island their home ground. The Physical Education complex offers gym space (2) whenever Randallâ€™s Island is not available. The complex also allows for weight room space, cardio work etc. The school provides all uniforms and all necessary equipment. The school also hires a full time athletic training staff. The players have access to injury assistance and general medical attention. The program has 4-5 coaches, all led by head coach: Luis M Echegaray.</p>
